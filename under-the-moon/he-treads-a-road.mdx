# He treads a road
- [He treads a road](#2) of ghost and gleam
- To please Him well my rhyme must be
- A dyed and figured mystery,
- Thought hid in thought, dream hid in dream.

# 祂踏着幽魂和幽光之路
- [祂踏着幽魂和幽光之路。](#1)
- 要讨祂欢喜，我的诗须是
- 一种有色又有形的神秘，
- 思藏在思里，梦藏在梦处。

<PoemFootnote>
Two drafts of this poem appear in the white manuscript album MBY 548, which also contains drafts of the remaining three poems printed below here, together with drafts of other work, much of which subsequently appeared in *The Wind Among the Reeds* (1899).

<PoemFootnote index={2}>
He treads a road of ghost and gleam: The earlier draft of this line begins “God loves the road” rather than “He treads a road.”

<PoemFootnote>
Compare “my rhyme must be / A dyed and figured mystery” here to “a song should he / A painted and he-pictured argosy” in lines 4-5 of “[Sir Roland](../sir-roland)” (poem 4, above) nearly a decade earlier.
