# An Old and Solitary One
- They say I’m proud and solitary, yes proud,
- Because my love and hate [abideth](#2) ever
- A changeless thing among the changing crowd
- Until the sleep, an high soul changes never.

<br />

- This crowd that mock at me, their love and hate
- Rove through the world and find no lasting home,
- Two spectral things that beg at many a gate
- O they are lighter than the windy foam.

<br />

- Full often have I loved in olden days
- But those I loved their hot hearts changed ever
- To coldness some and some to hate—always
- I am the same, an high soul changes never.

<br />

- And often [when](#1) I loved I fain would hate
- And [when](#2) I hated find for love an home,
- But have not changed though waxing old of late
- But they are lighter than the windy foam.

<br />

- And therefore I am proud and sad forever
- Until the sleep, an high soul changes never;
- The crowd, their love and hate hath never home,
- O they are lighter than the windy foam.

# 衰老而孤独者
- 他们说我傲慢又孤独，对，傲慢，
- 因为在不断变幻的人群中间
- 我的爱与恨永远都保持不变
- 直到长眠，高傲的灵魂永不变。

<br />

- 嘲笑我的人群，他们的爱与恨
- 在世上流浪，找不到固定家庭，
- 两个在许多门前乞讨的游魂，
- 啊，它们比风中的浪花还要轻。

<br />

- 从前的日子我往往爱到狂热，
- 可我爱的人总是变心，从热恋
- 有的到冷淡，有的到仇恨——而我
- 始终如一，高傲的灵魂永不变。

<br />

- 我在爱恋中往往也乐于憎恨，
- 憎恨中也为爱找到一个家庭，
- 虽然最近变老了却没有变更，
- 可是它们比风中浪花还要轻。

<br />

- 因此之故我永远傲慢而伤感，
- 直到长眠，高傲的灵魂永不变；
- 群众，他们的爱与恨永无家庭，
- 啊，它们比风中的浪花还要轻。

<PoemFootnote>
This early rondel-like example of Yeatsian aloofness appears on a leaf of paper with two quatrains (one of them published in both “In a Drawing Room” and “Quatrains and Aphorisms”) on the verso. The paper is watermarked 1882 and the draft of the quatrain appears earlier than its publication in *Dublin University Review* for January 1886.
