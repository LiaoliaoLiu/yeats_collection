# The Pathway
- Archangels were I God should go
-  Unhook the stars out of the sky
-  And in a sudden hurry fly
- And spread them in a shining row—
- A shining pathway as were meet.
-  I had alone my life for thee;
-  Tread gently tread most tenderly
- My life is under thy sad feet.

# 路径
- 我若是上帝，大天使就该去
- 　把星星都从天空中摘下来，
- 　忽然间又都急匆匆飞起来，
- 把它们散布成闪亮的一溜——
- 一条恰恰好闪亮的路径。
- 　我只有生命可以献给你；
- 　轻轻地踩啊，最轻柔地踩，
- 你悲伤的脚下是我的生命。

## 附

<PoemAppendix source="George Bornstein—">
<PoemFootnote>
In *The Rosy Cross* manuscript album (see above, [poem 31](../to-a-sister-of-the-cross/#1)) this poem follows immediately after “To a Sister of the Cross and the Rose” and, like that lyric, combines erotic and esoteric meanings. A very similar version called “Your Pathway” appears in the *Flame of the Spirit* manuscript collection as well, where it is dated July 5, 1891. In *The Rosy Cross*, Yeats crossed out “July” and substituted “August.”
