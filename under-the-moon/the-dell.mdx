# The Dell
- All the bees that in this country dwell
- Flying hither to this favoured dell
- Rob the honey from the blue hairbell
- Or fall victim to the chase
- Of some geni of the place
- Who hid deep within the purple rim
- With tight drawn bow awaiteth him.
- He will have no other powers
- Among his own beloved flowers,
- For merry fairies love to sip
- Sweet nectar from the flower’s lip.

# 谷地
- 这乡野居住的所有蜂子
- 都飞到这里这可爱谷地
- 从蓝铃花上面争抢花蜜
- 或沦为此地某精灵
- 追逐猎捕的牺牲品，
- 他深藏在那紫色花冠内，
- 拉满了弓弦在把它等待。
- 在自己心爱的花丛中间，
- 他不会拥有其他的权限，
- 因为快活的仙子们乐于
- 从花朵的唇上啜饮甘露。

## 附

<PoemAppendix source="George Bornstein—">
<PoemFootnote>
“The Dell” occupies the top part of a manuscript page and “[Inscription for a Christmas Card](../inscription-for-a-christmas-card)” (poem 20 in the present edition) the bottom part. It is one of Yeats’s earliest poems with a fairy reference; the bees, honey, bow, and flowers would likewise recur in his verse.
