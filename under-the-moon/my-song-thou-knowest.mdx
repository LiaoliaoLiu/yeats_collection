# My song thou knowest
- My song thou knowest of a dreaming castle—
- The pensive walls are like a woven net
- For cunning corbeils are in carving set
- Of fair flowers in a wreathed tassel—
- From old world [pages](#1) have they singing met.

# 你懂的我的歌
- 你懂的我的歌，关于梦幻城堡——
- 阴郁的城墙好像编织的网罗，
- 上面雕饰着精巧的花篮石刻，
- 盛放着美丽的花环，扎着流苏——
- 它们遇见过古代侍从唱着歌。

<PoemFootnote>
The address to his art, medieval or renaissance setting, and romantic diction are familiar elements of Yeats’s early work. This five-line poem is preserved in the same manuscript as a draft of the poem “Love and Death” published in *Dublin University Review* for May 1885, and probably dates from 1884 or early 1885.
