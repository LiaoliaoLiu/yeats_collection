# Tower wind-beaten grim
### 1.
- Tower wind-beaten grim
- The warmth of the ivy
- Has shrunken from thee,
- It saw the mocking grin

### 2.
- Of the ghosts on thy battlement,
- The ghosts of thy thousand years,
- And shaken with creeping fears
- The green tendrils back from you bent.

### 3.
- Once there rested a scholarly owl
- Hooting in a grey stone nook,
- Midnight chimed. The tower shook.
- He heard the spirits [frolic](#1) and howl.

### 4.
- The owl flew far through the night
- And much to himself did moan,
- At last he fell like a stone
- He was quite dead of fright.

### 5.
- Scatter-brained as a common fowl
- Thus died this learned bird
- Because he simply heard
- An anti-philosophic howl.

# 狂风吹打的碉楼
### 一
- 狂风吹打的碉楼，
- 常春藤蔓的暖意
- 已从你身边退避，
- 眼见你雉堞上头

### 二
- 悠悠千载的野鬼，
- 野鬼嘲讽的笑容，
- 它不禁瑟瑟震恐，
- 把绿色卷须缩回。

### 三
- 曾有学问枭落脚
- 啸叫在灰石墙头。
- 夜半钟响。碉楼抖。
- 它听见鬼魂欢闹。

### 四
- 那枭穿夜空远飞，
- 对自己伤悼不已，
- 终于像石头下坠，
- 它是因惊吓而死。

### 五
- 脑浆迸溅如常鸟，
- 学问枭如是身亡，
- 因为它只是听见
- 一阵反哲学叫嚣。

<PoemFootnote>
Yeats could occasionally be whimsical or humorous in his poetry, and this poem offers a good early example of those moods. Wind, tower, and ghosts, of course, would become major images in his later work, especially in regard to the opposition between natural and supernatural.
