# 瞧瞧那个人

瞧瞧那个人——瞧瞧他忧愁的前额，
他企图留住患病的月亮从天上
浓云笼罩的病榻窥望的柳木床
上面像影子一般掠过的生者
与死者——他一把揪住他们的头发，
令他们留下。他们竟一笑而过，
依旧赶他们的老路——生者与死者——
犹如经由害相思的狄多的阶下，
很久前海上驶过浪子的白帆船，
船舷被海浪的嘴唇激吻得光鲜。
他终于叹口气起身走自己的路，
忿怒到发狂——他，找遍了多于
所有的国度，及各国著名的爱欲
艺术——孑然惨遭遗弃的队伍。
1884年3月8日

# Behold the man

Behold the man—Behold his brow of care,
He sought to stay the living and the dead
That pass'd like shadows o'er an osier bed
On which from her high cloud-embosomed lair
The sick moon peers—He plucked them by the hair
And bade them stay. They smiled and passing led
Their ancient way—the living and the dead—
As o'er the sea from love-sick Dido's stair   8
Passed long ago the wanderer's white sailed ships
Enamoured of the waves' impetuous lips.
He sighing rose and took his way at length
In rage inhuman—He who sought for more
Than all the nations with their famous lore
Of love—alone a sad forsaken strength.
