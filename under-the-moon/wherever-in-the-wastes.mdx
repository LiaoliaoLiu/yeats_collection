# Wherever in the wastes
- Wherever in the wastes of wrinkling sand
- Worn by the tan of ever flaming time
- Longing for human converse, we have pitched
- A camp for musing in some seldom spot
- Of not unkindly nurture, and let loose
- To roam and ponder those sad dromedaries
- Our dreams, the Master of the pilgrimage
- Cries, “Nay—the caravan goes ever on,
- The goal lies further than the morning star.”

# 在荒野中无论何处
- 火焰常炽的时光之[扇](#1)所蚀损、
- 渴望人类言谈的起皱的沙漠
- 荒野中无论何处，我们一支起
- 帐篷，[为在某个并非不毛的](#2)
- [人迹罕至之所冥想](#2)，放任
- 我们的梦想，那些忧伤的骆驼，
- 漫游和沉思，朝圣之主就大喊：
- “不——大篷车继续不断前进，
- 目的地还在晨星之外的远方。”

## 附

<PoemFootnote index={1}>
扇：原文"tan"，[词源](https://www.etymonline.com/word/tan#etymonline_v_45100)，据维护者个人经验，此词多用于指太阳晒棕的皮肤颜色。

<PoemFootnote index={2}>
为在...冥想：很不理解傅浩对此处的处理，并非不毛原文"not unkindly nurture"，应该是与"seldom"形成对比，突出此地的"Longing for human converse"。亦不理解前文的“无论何处”从何而来。

<PoemAppendix source="George Bornstein—">
<PoemFootnote>
This nine-line poem is contained in a letter from Yeats to his friend the poet Katharine Tynan, dated June 25, 1887, and continued on July 1. I concur with the judgment of John Kelly in *The Collected Letters of W. B. Yeats, Volume One* that the poem was “probably composed by WBY for the occasion.” Tynan has left several amusing accounts of the early Yeats in her autobiography *Twenty-five* Years, including one of him reciting Shelley’s “The Sensitive Plant” during a rainstorm instead of holding the umbrella properly. “Wherever in the wastes” still remembers Shelley in its final image of the morning star, but also resembles Arthur Henry Hallam and, of course. Edward Fitzgerald’s version of the *Rubaiyat* of Omar Khayyam.
