# I heard a rose on the brim

- I heard a rose on the brim
- Of the moss in the wood-ways dim
-  On a rock’s rim,
- Where [prating](#2) the black birds meet
-  Where the paw of the squirrel rushes,
-  Sing to the soft wind’s gushes
- A song that was [giddy](#1) and sweet.

<br />

- “Dear wind I long to rest
- Upon thy song-heaved breast,
-  Wind of the west.”
- I saw the fingers close
-  Of the wind on the ruined glow,
-  I saw scattered petals a-blow.
- Ah rose, poor love-sick rose.

# 我听见一株玫瑰 

- 我听见一株玫瑰在幽暗
- 林间道旁的苔藓边缘
- 　一块岩石畔——
- 乌鹊在那里叫喳喳相聚，
- 　松鼠的爪子在那里紧刨——
- 　伴着柔风的吹拂吟啸
- 一支愚蠢而甜美的歌曲。

<br />

- “亲爱的风，我渴望歇息
- 在您载歌起伏的胸臆，
- 　西方的风气！”
- 我看见风的手指狎昵
- 　那横遭摧残的娇艳姿色；
- 　我看见花瓣被纷纷吹落。
- 玫瑰啊，可怜害相思的玫瑰！

<PoemFootnote>
This version of “I heard a rose” appears to be a slightly later reworking of a song in the first act of the unpublished early play variously referred to as *The Blindness, The Equator of Wild Olives*, and *The Epic of the Forest*. It dates from between 1883 (the date of the watermark) and 1886, when Yeats finally finished tinkering with the drama. The lyric owes a debt to Blake, particularly to “The Sick Rose” from *Songs of Experience*, and anticipates some of the poems that Yeats would later collect as *The Rose* and *The Wind Among the Reeds*.

prating: Yeats may have intended “prattling” instead of “prating”; the manuscript reads “pratting.”
