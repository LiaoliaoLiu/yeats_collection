# I sat upon a high gnarled root
- I sat upon a high gnarled root
- Counting the songs of sap and fruit
- When from a pine tree straight and tall
- That grew amid my mountain dens
- A small bird let some catches fall
- As though he would some song recall
- As is the way with wrens.
- Then from the pines’ eternal feet
- To him I cried these measures meet:
- “Peace be with you brother mine
- Peace be with you golden crested
- Peace unto you, somber breasted
- Dweller in the [tufted](#2) pine.
- [Whither](#3) is that song of thine
- That [bucolic](#4) wild of thine?
- In some fay-delighting glade
- In the soft and purple shade
- That the mountain ashes made
- By all other birds forgotten
- [Wast](#5) that song of thine begotten?”
- Then the wren this answer made:
- “In no fay-delighting glade
- By all other birds forgotten
- Was this song of mine [begotten](#6),
- But when the great sun revelled high
- And drunk the blood of hot July
- I sought the woodland’s sweet [dominions](#7)
- Where Zephyr sits with folden [pinions](#8)
- And the streams roll on in their mystic [slumbers](#10)
- Wearily beating their [dulcet](#11) numbers,
- Singing, singing, along
- And the still leaves rejoice
- As they fondle the voice
- [Of their sweet summer song.”](#1)

<br />

- Then a wonderful spirit arose
- Out of the soul of a wild wood rose,
- In its hand was a golden lyre
- Every note was a quivering fire.
- I trembled and gazed on his cold blue eyes
- Whose light was the light of far away skies,
- He sang me a song of primal things
- A tale of the souls of ancient springs,
- I think the [wee](#12) wild fairy folk
- In many hidden places
- And in the hearts of pine and oak
- Treasure the rhythmical paces,
- But I am very sad when I think
- As I sit here in the sun and blink
- Mayhap [’twas](#13) nothing at all
- Only the clarion call
- Of a far-off water fall.

# 我坐在高大虬结的树根上
- 我坐在高大虬结的树根上
- 数着树液与果实的歌唱，
- 忽然从生长在山谷中的
- 一棵又直又高的松树上，
- 一只小鸟把猎物掉落，
- 就仿佛它要回忆某支歌，
- 就像鹪鹩那样。
- 于是从松树永恒的脚下
- 我朝它喊出合律的这番话：
- “愿你平安，兄弟，
- 愿你平安，金冠者，
- 祝你平安，黑脯者，
- 蓬茸松间的居士。
- 你那歌哪里去了，
- 你那支乡曲野调？
- 在精灵欢喜的林地，
- 在山中梣树洒下的
- 柔和紫色的阴影里，
- 别的鸟都已遗忘处，
- 你那歌才得以生出？”
- 然后那鹪鹩作答如是：
- “不是在精灵欢喜的林地，
- 别的鸟都已遗忘处，
- 我这歌才得以生出，
- 而是当大太阳纵情恣意
- 畅饮炎热七月的热血时，
- 我寻觅林地的美妙领地：
- 在那里[西风](#9)敛翅栖息；
- 溪水在神秘睡眠中奔流，
- 倦怠地打着甜美的节奏，
- 一路唱啊，唱；
- 平静的树叶边欣赏
- 边抚弄那一阵阵
- 甜美的夏季歌声。”

<br />

- 于是一个奇妙的小仙子
- 从一朵野玫瑰灵魂中升起，
- 手握一把金色的竖琴，
- 每个音都是颤动的火星。
- 我颤抖着凝视他冷冷的蓝眼睛，
- 那眼光是遥远天空的光明；
- 他为我唱元始事物之歌，
- 古代泉水精灵的传说；
- 我想许多隐蔽之处，
- 松树橡树的内心里
- 那些小小野生仙族
- 都珍爱这节奏拍子，
- 但我在此坐在阳光里
- 想到那也许什么都不是，
- 只不过是远处瀑布
- 有如号角的啸呼，
- 就不禁悲伤痛苦。

<PoemFootnote>
“I sat upon a high gnarled root” is the last poem from the early album transcribed in the present edition. In general structure as a woodland vision and sometimes in specific phraseology (like that of the last three lines) it has similarities to “The Old Grey Man,” while as an early verse dialogue it anticipates “Love’s Decay” (transcribed below) and Yeats’s many published dialogue poems. Birds, of course, were among Yeats’s favorite symbols throughout his poetic career.

<PoemFootnote index={1}>
Of their sweet summer song: It is difficult to tell exactly where the wren’s song ends. I have followed here the most likely solution, but the manuscript’s irregular and overfrequent use of inverted commas, combined with the scantiness of its other punctuation, would allow for other choices. Indeed, the manuscript text concludes with a quotation mark.
