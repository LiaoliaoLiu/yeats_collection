# The Priest of Pan

- If the melancholy music of the spheres
- Ever be perplexing to his mortal ears,
- He flies unto the mountain
- And sitting by some fountain
- That in a beam of coolness from a mossy rock
- Plunges in a pool all bubbling with its shock,
- There he hears in the sound of the water falling
- The sweet-tongued [oriads]() to each other calling
- Secrets that for years
- Have escaped his ears.

# 潘的祭司

- 假如天体的忧郁音乐
- 总是困惑着他的耳朵，
- 他就逃到山间
- 坐在山泉旁边，
- 泉水闪着冷光，从生苔的岩石侧
- 跃入水潭，惊骇地泛着泡沫，
- 在那里，他在瀑布的声响中听见
- 嘴甜的山林女仙朝彼此呼喊
- 他的耳朵多年里
- 不曾听到的秘密。

<PoemAppendix source="叶芝诗集（增订本） 2018 ——">
#### 潘：古希腊神话中神使赫尔墨斯之子，山林、畜牧及繁殖之神，统辖山林仙女、羊头怪等一切山精水怪，人身而羊腿，头上生角，善音乐，发明排箫。潘的祭司应指其崇拜者。

<PoemAppendix source="George Bornstein—">
#### Pan: In Greek mythology Pan is the god of flocks and shepherds, and hence sometimes of nature in general. Images of fountains, rural escape, and secret wisdom would reappear throughout Yeats’s career.
#### Oriads: Oreads. In Greek mythology, oreads were nymphs associated with mountains and caves.
