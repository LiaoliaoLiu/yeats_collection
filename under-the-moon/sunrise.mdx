# Sunrise
- The young leaves spring, the cattle low,
- The torrents in the valley go
- On thirsting for the ocean’s flow,
-   Loud they rejoice
-   Hearing his voice.
- Reddning is the mountain’s comb,
- Voices as of elf or gnome
- Through the twisted valleys roam
-   And gently croon
-   That ancient rune,
- At the touch of [Proserpine](#2)
- Of the [loom](#3) among the pine
- Swept from every golden line
-   How it sweeps
-   Up the steeps,
- Round each heather bell it floats
- While merle and throstle gloats
- On its wild and tender notes.
-   The morning red
-   From yonder head
- Sweeping down the mountain side
- Past the pine trees in their pride
- To the ravine’s gullet wide
-   [Doth](#4) pursue
-   The flying dew.
- At last from the shroud
- Of many a domed cloud
- The sun rushes proud
-   Of his restless fire,
-   Wild with desire
- To browse upon the [dancing](#3) light
- Of the moon whose sickle bright
- Reapeth the barren night,
-   On the steel-like flare
-   Of her streaming hair.

# 日出
- 嫩叶茁长，牛群吼，
- 山谷中洪流奔走
- 渴望海洋的激流；
- 　听见海涛声，
- 　溪水大欢腾。
- 山峦的冠子正变红；
- 精灵或矮仙的喉咙
- 游荡在曲折峡谷中，
- 　轻柔地唱和
- 　那古老哀歌；
- [冥后](#1)只轻轻触及
- 松林中间的织机，
- 抚过每一根金丝，
- 　歌声就飘扬，
- 　升到高崖上，
- 绕朵朵石楠花飘浮，
- 野蛮而温柔的旋律
- 令乌鸫和画眉侧目。
- 　远处山头上
- 　清晨的红光
- 顺山腰向下奔泻
- 从茂盛松林掠过，
- 向峡谷咽喉滑落，
- 　紧紧地追逐
- 　逃跑的露珠。
- 终于摆脱了云和雾
- 重重包围的裹尸布，
- 太阳冲出来，骄傲于
- 　不息的火焰，
- 　因欲望狂癫，
- 去啃食跳舞的月光——
- 月亮的镰刀明晃晃
- 收割了黑夜的歉荒——
- 　她流动的发
- 　钢似的光华。

<PoemFootnote index={1}>
古希腊神话传说，谷物女神得墨忒耳的女儿珀耳塞福涅被冥王哈得斯劫去，强娶为后。得墨忒耳悲痛不已，到处寻找，以致土地荒芜，饥馑发生。于是主神宙斯命令哈得斯准许珀耳塞福涅每年春季返回地上，秋季回到地下，从此才有了四季循环。此诗原文用的是珀耳塞福涅在古罗马神话中的名字普洛塞耳皮那。

<PoemFootnote>
This expression of natural energy and desire rates among the most technically polished of Yeats’s unpublished work of the 1880s. The poem’s five-line units, alternating three rhymed tetrameter lines with two of dimeter in an *aaabb* pattern, frequently spill over metrically and syntactically. The reference to “elf or gnome” in line 7 presages the Irish turn that Yeats would shortly take, in contrast to the classical invocation of Proserpine in line 11

<PoemFootnote index={2}>
Proserpine: In classical mythology, Proserpine (or Persephone) was the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. In some accounts she was carried off to Hades by Dis, and thus became associated both with the underworld and with rituals of agricultural fertility.

dancing: Yeats may have written “daring” rather than “dancing.”
