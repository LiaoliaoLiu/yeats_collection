# [Sir Roland](#2)

### 1.
- When to its end o’er-ripened July nears
- One lurid eve befell mine history—
- No rime empassioned of envenomed years
- Or the embattled earth—a song should be
- A painted and be-pictured argosy,
- And as a crew to guide her wandering days
- Sad love and change yea those that sisters be
- For they upon each other’s eyes do gaze
- And they do whisper in each other’s ears always.

### 2.
- As gently down the apple blossom dropped
- As is the muffled tread of misery,
- The creepers that no envious sickle cropt
- With flowers bemisted every plumy tree
- In [Lethe](#4)’s valley by the silent sea,
- And then at times from out the wood advances
- A shadowy thing and where the billows flee
- Along the sand and ’mong their foamy glances
- A moment to and fro the elfin shadow dances.

### 3.
- Upon the hem of the unfruitful sand
- An old man passed with visage worn and wan
- And time had seamed his brow with many a band,
- A [Templar](#6) cross of red was sewn upon
- His shoulders thin, his eyes but dimly shone
- And he at times at that thing or at this
- Of memory would smile, but had when done
- A pilgrim’s face—O lonely thy path is
- The way. His comrades are mainly ’mong the dead I [wis](#7).
### 4.
- He drew anigh to where upon the south
- Clothed in a wood of hazel and of lime
- ’Mong goblin fruitage gazed the haunted valley’s mouth.
- Weak voicéd he began an ancient rime—
- The long waves were a chorus with their chime—
- A song forlorn about a lady fair
- Who in the old forgotten barbarous time
- In iron Norway loved a dead corsair
- And till she faded would across the dim seas stare.

### <s>5.</s>
- <s>Sir Roland passed in singing that old stave</s>
- <s>Within the mouth of Lethe’s vale profound</s>
- <s>That gazed across the ever labouring wave,</s>
- <s>And there there seeméd breathing from the ground</s>
- <s>In all the dim and dolorous vale around</s>
- <s>Some soul forlorn of old unhappy love</s>
- <s>And from the waves now veiled with trees a sound</s>
- <s>Of sighs and from the vale and trees thereof</s>
- <s>And from the fruited creepers hanging from above.</s>

### 6.
- And now within the valley’s mouth he came
- Upon his ears the sun by night [appalled](#9)
- Sank slowly seaward rolled in horded flame;
- The fakéd fire within the valley crawled
- Along the giant fruits the owlets called
- A ghastly ever-growing company
- From where the steep some long dead man had walled,
- Soon all things else but these things sleeping be,
- The owls that hoot round cliff and wall and crumbling tree.

### <s>6.</s>
- <s>Anigh the valley’s head a fountain sprang</s>
- <s>Nearby a twisted fruit tree’s shadow dappled</s>
- <s>By bounteous eve begilded while it sang—</s>
- <s>Beneath the trees when autumn comes, o’er-appled</s>
- <s>Now flower-pale—upon the shadow dappled</s>
- <s>A huge knight lay whose calm eyes softly shed</s>
- <s>A far-off gaze as of some ghost unchapelled</s>
- <s>Of one who once in immemorial ages bled</s>
- <s>Yea as the far-off gaze of one for ages dead.</s>

### <s>7.</s>
- <s>So far the joys and sorrows of the world</s>
- <s>Had fled from him who lay where eve’s red flake</s>
- <s>Of flame dancéd upon the fountain curled,</s>
- <s>And old he was, he to Sir Roland spake:</s>
- <s>“Old man, whence comest thou for what deeds</s>
- <s>Thus heavy armed, for gleamings clear of plated mail</s>
- <s>From ’mong the crimson of thy vestments break?</s>
- <s>O knight, for thou art such, what rumoured tale</s>
- <s>Of high emprizes leads thee unto Lethe’s vale?”</s>

### 8.
- Then Roland spake: “Old knight, drawn unto thee
- I come upon no quest of high renown,
- Of late I rode upon a far journey
- But fain to ease mine horse I lighted down
- Thinking to go afoot along the brown
- Sea sand for he was weary with the way,
- But sudden from a bursting billow’s crown
- A sea snake glided and in wild dismay
- My good horse fled, wherefore within the valley grey

### 9.
- I seek thy help, o thou whom Mary keep.”
- Then rose the dreamer and while a drooping bough
- Of apple blossom light as fairy sleep
- Snowed o’er with crimson all the dreamer’s brow,
- And through the silence of the valley now
- Passed on these twain. The history of the vale
- Sir Roland longed for eagerly I trow
- Yet would not ask—but soon unbade this tale
- The clear-browed dreamer told within the hollow dale.

### 10.
- “I ruled of yore a land where warless castles
- Lay by their fields of grain and cattle folds
- —A feastful land—I ruled o’er joyous vassals
- Who gathered often in my castle hold
- Where sea tales on the winter eves were told
- By some swart rover who with his long vessels
- Measured the seas for merchandize or gold
- Where some spice isle upon the ocean nestles
- Or wind with polar water in the darkness wrestles.
### 11.
- I was most blest fore all mine were, the coy
- And wild lark liberty who hath her broods
- ’Mong barren hills and the swift blind eagle joy—
- And love who seeks alone dear solitudes
- To muse on her high kinsman grief—the woods
- And water saw the boundaries of my lands
- And knew them wide—yet by the fleecy floods
- All these I did renounce when homeward bands
- Of hunters left me lingering ’lone upon the sands.

### <s>12.</s>
- <s>Upon the surf-besiegéd shore I stood,</s>
- <s>I stood and gazed upon the leaping wave.</s>
- <s>The funeral pyre of day was red as blood,</s>
- <s>The white maned horses of the sea did rave</s>
- <s>Where the fire did descend himself to lave</s>
- <s>Forgetful of their ancient flood. Within</s>
- <s>And then I saw a plunging vessel drave</s>
- <s>Forth from the flame yea from the flame and din</s>
- <s>And soon her keel the surf-besieged shore did win.</s>

### 13.
- And from her came a man like those of story
- A dateless weariness was in his eyes
- Unhuman sorrow and unhuman glory—
- A raven darkest minion of the skies
- Before him flew, and still before him flies,
- And he anigh me drew and from a lyre
- Within his [[ ? ]](#12) hands I heard arise
- Sweet song but on my soul there came a fire
- That never shall till comes the end of days expire.

### 14.
- He sang of [Ingiborg](#14) the fair dead maid
- Whose feet a-roving are in harvest plain
- Land of the Asphodels that never fade
- O land beyond the springs of the swift rain.
- He sang of how afar beyond the main
- In vine-hung vales where summer hath her home
- She will at times descend when evenings pale,
- Then ceased the song—I gazed, and saw the foam
- Smoking along the waves and heard their voices moan.

### 15.
- But no black vessel lay among the surf
- And no man with a raven by me was
- Nor by the neighbouring vale whose plumy turf
- Was heavy with the sheep-delighting grass
- Nor by the wood-hung river did he pace.
- Then musing I strode on mine homeward way;
- Above the castle in a drowsy mass
- The banner hung. The bees from toil of day
- Were resting in their hives below the walls’ old grey.

### 16.
- And sudden round me did I summon them,
- My dark sea-nurtured people every one,
- And chose a stalwart crew of firm-souled men
- And manned a vessel and when all was done
- Forth from the shadow of the shore sailed on
- From ’mong the mourning people, on we sailed
- Till of the noise of the land were none
- And last till fragrance of the harvest failed,
- The throbbing stars were o’er us and the sea fowl hailed

### 17.
- From wave to wave each other ’mong the foam,
- And on we sailed by land the seas enfold
- And shores where ceaseless summer hath her home
- And where the vine is, still the live sea rolled
- And the bell-tongued billows tolled and tolled and tolled
- Around a fleeting ship, and man by man
- My sea-worn sailors died and neath the mold
- Of far-off isles were laid where their lives’ span
- Of wide world wandering to a lonely finish ran.

### 18.
- Now here I dwelt upon the world’s wide face
- Those never more to be consoléd dwell
- Here Joy and Sorrow have no dwelling place
- Such as are echoes in some wave-worn shell
- Mere dream-winged sounds that can no story tell,
- My years shall flow in final pace I ween
- Till I shall leave in silence this lone dell
- And live within the wandering isle serene
- With fair-haired Ingiborg the dead Norwegian queen.”

### 19.
- He ceased—the echoes of the hollow vale
- Died slowly fondling the well-loved sound
- Of that dear name through all the dinful dale
- The flowers that among the branches wound
- Seemed singing o’er the dim becharméd ground
- With little voices sweet and numerous
- “With joy as deep we on our petals bound
- When thy dear name descending dwells with us
- [As when the bees are on our petals luminous.”](#15)

### 20.
- As though in shadow of a willow tree
- Drowsed Cupid weary grown of love and scorn
- Till some name famous in his [psaltery](#17)
- Came dreaming on the sleeping ear out-worn,
- And he went forth with torch and bow upborn
- So swiftly in the windless valley there
- The great fruits woke as in the song of morn
- All swinging swinging swinging in the air
- And in each gleamed a goblin fire wild and rare.

### 21.
- They stood—the valley lilies those that listen
- Forever with their ears upon the ground
- Did round their feet along the pathway glisten.
- Spake Roland, “Surely thou art he the sound
- Of whose great name has gone the wide world round,
- Olaf the hero Dane.” “Yea I am he,”
- The other spake. Now in a wood profound
- The twain had come to where did Roland see
- Among this dimness rise a cliff impassable.

### [21[a].](#18)
- And all the voiceful legions of the land
- Within the moonless windless night were still,
- All slept I think—all save alone the falling sand
- Of change who wrings from love her tokens ill
- All else—Nay nay I wish each mountain rill
- Was not unmindful of its weeping cry.
- Impassable the cliff wall seemed until
- They came the wood engirdled base anigh,
- And then appeared a stairway on its surface high.

### 22.
- Along the stair to where the cliff uprises
- High as the roving kestrel sails they passed—
- High as the kestrel whose fierce soul surmises
- And dreams of quarry musing in the [breast](#20)
- That drives him ever onward fast and fast—
- A cave they found anear the cliff wall’s head—
- The stars their brethren were—The earth was past,
- Unto the listening stars the cavern shed
- A muffled tune of hidden streams uncomforted,

### 23.
- ’Twas there the hermit knight Sir Olaf bode.
- On either side a black stone figure bore
- Upon his shoulders wide the ponderous lode
- Of that wide dome which hung the cavern o’er
- Down through a chasm in the riven floor
- Belching above a stream did shrieking go,
- One crouching statue at the waters hoar
- Pointed for ever with his arm, as though
- He numbered all the drops of water in their flow.

### 24.
- The other’s eyes were fixéd on the sky
- The sleepless baleful eyeballs dark as night
- He watched how rose and set continually
- How ebbed and flowed the stars and planets bright
- Mirrored upon his eye in wandering light
- The stars a thousand ages rose and set

<p><center>[......](#21)</center></p>

### 27.
- The weeping wind seemed ever singingly
- Unto the vale that heard insatiate
- To whisper some forlorn old history
- Of some once fair now star bebaffled fate.
- At last these words did grow articulate:
- “[Sansloy](#22) my name is, joy I ever seek,
- O surely she doth somewhere hidden wait
- By mere or mountain or by shady creek—
- Hath thou seen joy?” and dying then the voice grew weak

### 28.
- And ceased. The swift-tongued colloquist
- The lonely sea sang forth these words anon:
- “O vale, o shore my waves have often kissed,
- Knowest thou me? Each wave-worn skeleton
- Knows well my name Sansfoy, and ever on
- Reaching the world for joy I rush and rush.
- Tell me, o thou whose days in silence run,
- Dost thou hold her from me, o valley lush?”
- Then sudden fell upon the land a bodeful hush

### 29.
- Till in the midmost of the elfin dale
- Began a honeyed voice with veiled singing,
- Then loud and swift till all the eager vale
- By cliff and wood and reedy pool was ringing.
- O spirit of the valley, song-soul flinging
- Thy voice of tears upon the shrinking earth,
- O nightingale most surely thou wert bringing
- This answer in thy song: “O sea wave curled
- O moth-like wings of wind, o wind with wings enfurled

### 30.
- And wherefore question me thou sea and wind?
- To muse on sorrow is my days’ employ,
- Twain whom in your searching no bands bind
- Ye know not that I am named Sansjoy
- The self-same as the long dead paynim boy
- Yet this alone of all things do I know
- That nothing’s holy saving only joy”—
- Died the song-soul’s singing down below
- And from the forms of stone there came an echo low.

# [罗兰爵士](#1)
### 一
- 熟透的七月临近末尾的时节，
- 一个绚丽的黄昏降临我故事——
- 诗韵的激情不会从苦难岁月
- 或战乱大地获得——一首歌应是
- 一艘涂着彩画又如画的船只；
- 充当它漫游日子导航的船员
- 是哀婉爱情和变故这对姊妹；
- 她们总是凝视着彼此的双眼
- 她们总是窃窃私语在彼此的耳边。

### 二
- 在寂静大海边上的[忘川](#3)河谷，
- 一如苹果花轻柔地向下飘落，
- 一如被覆盖起来的悲惨小路，
- 藤蔓没有遭嫉妒的镰刀收割，
- 用花的薄雾笼罩着李树棵棵；
- 在似影之物不时从树林里面
- 冒出之时，在巨浪沿沙滩逃脱
- 之处，在点点浪沫的瞥视中间，
- 林妖的身影往来舞蹈了片刻时间。

### 三
- 在不毛不实的沙滩边缘上面，
- 有一个面容憔悴的老人走过；
- 时光给他的额头缀了许多线，
- 一枚[圣殿红十字](#5)在上面缝合。
- 他肩膀瘦削，眼光只微微闪烁，
- 时不时因想起这事忆起那事
- 而微笑，但过后就又恢复本色，
- 一副朝圣者面孔——道路孤寂兮
- 且独行。我知道他的同伴大都已死。

### 四
- 他走近一处地方，在朝南方向
- 覆盖着一片榛树和柠檬树林，
- 闹鬼谷口在妖怪果实间张望。
- 声音微弱他开口把古诗唱吟——
- 长波轰鸣是相和的合唱乐音——
- 凄凉的歌声唱一位淑女窈窕
- 在那久已被遗忘的野蛮年份
- 在黑铁挪威爱一个已死海盗，
- 愿眺望茫茫大海直到她玉殒香消。

### [五](#8)
- Sir Roland passed in singing that old stave
- Within the mouth of Lethe’s vale profound
- That gazed across the ever labouring wave,
- And there there seeméd breathing from the ground
- In all the dim and dolorous vale around
- Some soul forlorn of old unhappy love
- And from the waves now veiled with trees a sound
- Of sighs and from the vale and trees thereof
- And from the fruited creepers hanging from above.

### 六
- 此刻他来到谷口的范围之内，
- 耳畔的太阳被夜色涂成白色，
- 裹挟着大片火焰向海中沉坠；
- 河谷中蜿蜒的火光沿着壮硕
- 果实逶迤；绝壁上古人加筑了
- 墙垣之处，雏枭们从那里呼叫
- 大群可怕地不断增多的同伙，
- 除了这些其他的一切将睡着——
- 绕着悬崖、残墙和朽木啼叫的鸱枭。

### 六
- Anigh the valley’s head a fountain sprang
- Nearby a twisted fruit tree’s shadow dappled
- By bounteous eve begilded while it sang—
- Beneath the trees when autumn comes, o’er-appled
- Now flower-pale—upon the shadow dappled
- A huge knight lay whose calm eyes softly shed
- A far-off gaze as of some ghost unchapelled
- Of one who once in immemorial ages bled
- Yea as the far-off gaze of one for ages dead.

### 七
- So far the joys and sorrows of the world
- Had fled from him who lay where eve’s red flake
- Of flame dancéd upon the fountain curled,
- And old he was, he to Sir Roland spake:
- “Old man, whence comest thou for what deeds
- Thus heavy armed, for gleamings clear of plated mail
- From ’mong the crimson of thy vestments break?
- O knight, for thou art such, what rumoured tale
- Of high emprizes leads thee unto Lethe’s vale?”

### 八
- 于是罗兰说：“老骑士，来到此处，
- 我找您并非为寻求崇高名誉。
- 最近我骑马走上漫长的路途，
- 但为了让马歇歇我跳下马去，
- 正想要沿着棕色的海滩徒步
- 前行，因为马已经实在走不动，
- 可突然一阵巨浪巅峰上冲出
- 一条海蛇来，我的马受惊发疯
- 跑掉了，因此来到这灰色河谷之中，

### 九
- 我寻求您的帮助，圣母保佑者。”
- 梦中人闻言起身，低垂的一枝
- 苹果花轻如仙子的睡梦似的
- 顿时泼洒了梦中人满头胭脂；
- 这时候透过河谷的悄然静寂，
- 这两人继续谈下去。爵士罗兰
- 急于了解河谷的历史，我估计，
- 尚未及问——这故事却迅速抢先，
- 额头清明的梦中人在这空谷所言。

### 十
- “从前我统治一方领土，城堡
- 无战事，与农田牛圈共处相依
- ——喜庆的领土——治下快乐的臣属
- 常常聚集在我的城堡寨墙里，
- 冬夜听某个皮肤黝黑的浪子
- 讲航海故事：他跟随长船队列
- 跨越大海去寻找商品或金子；
- 汪洋之上有香料之岛似鸟窠，
- 狂风与极地巨浪在黑暗之中肉搏。

### 十一
- 我最有福气，因为我拥有一切：
- 荒丘孵卵的羞怯野生云雀般
- 自由，迅捷无畏的鹰隼般快乐——
- 独自找寻难得僻静处以思念
- 高贵亲戚“忧伤”的爱情——亲见
- 我领土边界，知其宽广的森林
- 流水——但在白浪翻滚的洪水边，
- 这些我全都放弃，当时一群群
- 回家猎人把我独丢在沙滩上逡巡。

### [十二](#10)
- Upon the surf-besiegéd shore I stood,
- I stood and gazed upon the leaping wave.
- The funeral pyre of day was red as blood,
- The white maned horses of the sea did rave
- Where the fire did descend himself to lave
- Forgetful of their ancient flood. [Within](#11)
- And then I saw a plunging vessel drave
- Forth from the flame yea from the flame and din
- And soon her keel the surf-besieged shore did win.

### 十三
- 从船上下来一人似传说中来，
- 他眼中满是绵绵无尽的倦意：
- 非人的愁郁和着非人的光采——
- 一只渡鸦，天空中最黑的东西，
- 在他前方飞，总是在他前方飞；
- 他朝我跟前走来，手中抱持着
- 一把竖琴，我听见响起了优美
- 乐曲，但我的灵魂燃起一团火，
- 直烧到世界的末日来临才会熄灭

### 十四
- 他唱[茵姬菠](#13)那美丽已故少女，
- 她足迹踏遍那片丰收的平原，
- 那永不凋谢的水仙盛开之土，
- 啊，那远在急雨激流外的田园。
- 他唱远在汪洋大海的那一边，
- 在葡萄满藤、夏季安居的山谷，
- 天色昏黄时她会不时地降临。
- 然后停止了歌唱——我凝望，目睹
- 海浪起沫如烟雾，耳闻涛声似哀哭。

### 十五
- 可是没有黑船在拍岸惊涛中，
- 我眼前也没有伴随渡鸦之人
- 曾经在附近河谷——遍地似羊绒
- 铺满令羊群欢喜的厚厚绿茵，
- 或者在垂柳丛生的河边游吟。
- 边沉思我边大步踏上回家路；
- 城堡上无精打采悬挂着旗旌。
- 蜜蜂们辛劳忙碌了一天之后，
- 正在灰色的老墙下蜂巢之中暂休。

### 十六
- 突然间我召集他们到我身边，
- 大海养育的每个黝黑的人手，
- 挑选了一群意志坚定的壮汉，
- 装备了一艘船，万事俱备之后，
- 我们从海岸的阴影之中驶出，
- 离开哀戚的人群扬帆去航行，
- 直到陆地的嘈杂声丝毫不留，
- 直到丰收的谷物香无踪无影，
- 跳动的星星在头顶，海鸟欢叫啼鸣。

### 十七
- 从浪尖到浪尖，出没浪花之间，
- 我们航行过汪洋包围的陆地
- 和无尽长夏所居、葡萄藤蜿蜒
- 所在的海岸；大海翻腾不息，
- 巨浪似洪钟敲击敲击再敲击，
- 环绕飘摇的船只；一人接一人，
- 受大海折磨的水手死去，葬在
- 遥远海岛的口岸，在那里他们
- 周游世界的人生归于寂寞的终尽。

### 十八
- 现在我住在世界宽阔的表面，
- 永不再得到安慰者所居之地，
- 在此处欢乐和忧愁没有家园，
- 不像回声住在浪淘的螺壳里——
- 只是不会讲故事的翩翩梦呓；
- 我相信我的岁月将流到干涸，
- 直到我默默离开这寂寞谷地，
- 到那宁静的漫游之岛上生活，
- 陪伴那已故挪威女王秀发茵姬菠。”

### 十九
- 他说完——空旷河谷的阵阵回音
- 把心爱之名那可爱读音爱抚，
- 回荡在整个幽谷中，渐渐退隐；
- 树枝间缭绕纠缠的繁花簇簇
- 在中魔的朦胧地面之上仿佛
- 用无数细小的甜美嗓音歌唱：
- “你心爱之名降临与我们同住，
- 我们把深深快乐聚在花瓣上，
- 如蜜蜂在我们明艳花瓣之上临降。”

### 二十
- 犹如在一棵柳树的阴影里面，
- 倦于爱情与轻蔑，睡着[小爱神](#16)，
- 直到有盛名传扬自他的诗篇，
- 前来在磨损的熟睡耳边造梦，
- 于是他抄起弓矢把火炬高擎，
- 迅速前往无风的河谷那一带，
- 硕大的果实如在晨曲中觉醒，
- 全都在空气中摇摆摇摆摇摆，
- 每一颗里面都闪着鬼火又野又怪。

### 二十一
- 他们站起来——那些永远把耳朵
- 贴在地面上聆听的幽谷铃兰
- 在路旁围绕他们的脚边闪烁。
- 罗兰说：“您肯定就是那位好汉，
- 他的大名已经在全世界传遍，
- 丹麦英雄欧拉夫。”“不错，我正是，”
- 另一位说道。此刻在深邃林间，
- 二人来到一处，罗兰在幽暗里
- 看见了一堵不可逾越的绝壁升起。

### [二十一〔甲〕](#19)
- 这块土地上一切有声的群族
- 在无月无风的夜里归于寂寥，
- 都睡了，我想——除了无常的沙漏
- 仍自爱情中挤出不祥的征兆，
- 别的一切——不不，我希望每一道
- 山溪都不会不在意放声哭泣。
- 那绝壁看来似不可逾越，直到
- 他们走近那林木环绕的崖底，
- 眼前才现出直通绝壁高处的梯级。

### 二十二
- 沿着那通往绝壁之巅的梯级
- 他们爬到如鹞鹰翱翔的高处——
- 高处的鹞鹰凶猛的灵魂构思
- 梦想在胸中酝酿已久的猎捕，
- 驱使它越来越快地俯冲猛扑——
- 在接近崖顶处发现一个洞穴——
- 群星与他们为伴——大地已远去，
- 那洞穴向着倾听的群星倾泻
- 不满的隐蔽溪流的一曲沉闷音乐。

### 二十三
- 隐逸骑士欧拉夫就住在此处。
- 两边各有一尊黑石像，用厚实
- 肩膀扛着沉重的巨石，支撑住
- 那悬在洞穴上方的宽阔顶盖；
- 通过洞顶上裂开的一道缝隙，
- 一股流泉汩汩地喷涌而下注；
- 一尊跪伏的雕像永远用手臂
- 指向须发灰白的水瀑，就仿佛
- 他在计数着飞流直下的颗颗水珠。

### 二十四
- 另一位目不转睛注视着天际，
- 不眠的愁苦眼眸黑暗如夜色。
- 他静观恒星和行星璀璨熠熠
- 漫游的光亮在眼中闪闪映射，
- 不断地升升降降如潮起潮落。
- 群星一千个世纪中升升降降

<p><center>[......](#21)</center></p>

### 二十七
- 哭泣的风儿仿佛永远在唱歌，
- 向着那总也听不厌足的河谷
- 低声讲述久已被遗忘的传说，
- 那曾经美丽如今不幸的命途。
- 最后如下这些话渐渐变清楚：
- “我名叫[无法](#22)，我永远寻找快乐，
- 哦，她肯定在某个隐秘处等候，
- 海边山麓或树荫浓密的湖泊——
- 您可曾见过快乐？”然后风声渐衰弱

### 二十八
- 而静止。快嘴快舌的接话茬者
- 那寂寞大海接着唱出这些话：
- “我的浪涛常吻的河谷岸滩哟，
- 你认识我吗？每具浪淘的骨架
- 都熟知我的名字无信；我冲啊
- 冲啊，总是想到达尘世寻快乐。
- 告诉我，默默过着日子的你呀，
- 葱郁的谷地，你把她藏起来了？”
- 然后地上骤降下一片不祥的静默，

### 二十九
- 直到在充满精灵的幽谷深处
- 响起了朦胧歌唱的甜蜜声音，
- 越来越洪亮而急促，漫山遍谷
- 崖畔林间苇塘边都急切回应。
- 你啊，山谷的精灵，歌曲的魂灵，
- 把带泪啼鸣投向萎缩的地上，
- 夜莺啊，你用你的歌无疑确定
- 传达着如此回答：“翻卷的海浪、
- 翅膀收起的风哟、风的飞蛾般翅膀，

### 三十
- 海和风你们到底为何打听我？
- 沉思烦恼乃是我日常的工作。
- 不受约束而任意搜寻的二者，
- 你们不知道我其实名叫无乐，
- 名同那逝去已久的异教小伙，
- 但万事万物中我只懂得此理：
- 除了快乐没有什么是神圣者”——
- 歌曲灵魂的歌唱在下方沉寂，
- 从石刻雕像那里传来了回音低低。

Partly in imitation of Spenser’s *The Faerie Queene*, this early (probably 1884) knightly narrative is written in Spenserian stanzas, nine-line units rhymed ababbcbcc with the first eight in iambic pentameter and the last in iambic hexameter. Like Shelley, Spenser was a particularly important precursor for the young Yeats, who edited *Poems of Spenser* for publication in 1906 and reprinted its introduction as “Edmund Spenser” in his own prose collection *The Cutting of an Agate*. Yeats did not bring this poem to quite so finished a state as most of the others in the present volume, resulting in a less polished and occasionally obscure text.

Templar: A Templar was a member of the Knights Templars, an order of knighthood founded in the early twelfth century to protect pilgrims en route to Jerusalem. Its growing wealth and political power aroused strong opposition from European rulers, and it was officially suppressed by the pope in 1312.

Yeats apparently marked this stanza (#5) for deletion, along with the second stanza six (lines 55-63) and stanza seven (lines 64-72). I have placed all three of those stanzas within brackets （维护者按：[]所包含内容在原文中换成了划线） to indicate apparent deletion, but have included them in the main text because by describing first the valley and then within it the old knight who will shortly take over the narration, they make the plot easier to follow.

Yeats also marked this stanza (#12) for deletion. I have placed it in brackets (维护者按：划线) to indicate that, but have included it for its help in making the narrative more comprehensible.

Within: The word “Within” began a phrase. “Within / The waters,” continued in the next line. When Yeats canceled “The waters,” he left “Within” syntactically isolated at the end of line 114 (where it does fulfill the needs of rhyme).

[ ? ]: There is an illegible word, indicated here by a bracketed question mark, before “hands.”

Ingiborg: Ingiborg (also Ingeborg and other variants) was a Danish princess who married the king of France in 1193. But given the description “Ingiborg the dead Norwegian queen” in line 171, Yeats more likely means the character in the Norwegian saga of Frithioth the Bold. A translation of that work by Yeats’s early mentor William Morris first appeared in 1871.

As ... petals luminous.: At the top of the next page Yeats wrote, “When through the wind thy sweet name [ ? ? ],” which he may have intended as a revision to stanza 19.

psaltery: A psaltery is a stringed musical instrument, but Yeats presumably means “psalter,” which refers to the Book of Psalms and, hence, in Roman Catholic ritual a series of 150 sentences or aspirations commemorating certain mysteries. The literal manuscript spelling is “phasaltery.”

breast: The manuscript may read “beast” instead of “breast.”

......: This section of the manuscript (NLI 30328) breaks off here at the bottom of a page. The remainder of stanza 24 is missing, as are stanzas 25 and 26. The text resumes with NLI 30440, which begins with stanza 27.

Sansloy: Sansloy (Lawless), like Sansfoy (Faithless) in line 245 and Sansjoy (Joyless) in line 262, is a figure in the first book of Spenser’s epic *Faerie Queene*, where he opposes the Redcrosse Knight.
</PoemFootnote>
<PoemFootnote index={23}>
END: Although this version of the poem is marked “END” after this line, Yeats used similar material on other occasions. The two stanzas below, which appear with the manuscript of “Sir Roland,” are not fully Spenserian in form (the first has seven rather than nine lines, and the second breaks off in the middle of line 8), but they resemble the concluding stanzas of “Sir Roland” in subject, diction, and tone. They are written with ink and paper similar to those of the main poem and may be part of an alternative draft.

### 28.
- *Low hums the wind and as the smoky rings*
- *Fall ring on ring from kindling watch-fires heart*
- *And light wherewith dumb nature speaks and sings*
- *Pours forth—so humming from the wind’s soul start*
- *Sound rings on rings and withering depart*
- *Unto the cavern high with fluttering flight*
- *The word arose—yea speech is nature’s spoken light*

### 29.
- *“Sansloy my name is and all chains I hurl*
- *Afar for fain would I free-pinioned seek*
- *Joy’s footing on the sea or where the merle*
- *Goes through the shadowy woods with flutings weak,*
- *And I have asked all things that shine or speak,*
- *The glow worms and the old owls in their trees,*
- *Where dwelleth Joy by mere or mountain peak*
- *Or sea but*
