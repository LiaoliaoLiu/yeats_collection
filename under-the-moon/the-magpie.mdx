# The Magpie

- Over the heath has the magpie flown
-  Over the hazel cover,
- Ah why will a magpie live alone
-  He waits for the lady and lover.
- “What may be the sadness that ends your smile?”
-  She said, “My peace is o’er, love”
- “I am going afar for so brief a while”
-  She said, “We must no more, love.”

<br />

- They stood for the swish of the mower’s blade
-  As they went round the meadow,
- And under him as he sang and swayed
-  Moved his meridian shadow.
- “The ruddy young reaper he sings be glad
-  In the sphere of the earth is no flaw, love.”
- She said, “He is singing all lives grown sad
-  He knows no other law, love.”

<br />

- The grass and the sedge and the little reed wren
-  A sociable world were talking
- And the water was saying enough for ten
-  As they by the stream went walking.
- “The grass and the sedge and the little reed wren
-  Are saying it low and high, love,
- There’s a feast in the forest and mirth in the fen.”
-  She said, “Ah how they sigh, love.”

<br />

- He flew by the meadow and flew by the brake
-  She saw him over the [flag](#2) fly
- Down by the marsh, with his tail a-shake
-  Alone with himself the magpie.
- “What may be the sadness that ends your smile?”
-  She said, “My peace is o’er, love.”
- Ah who with folly from love beguiled
-  She said, “We must no more, love.”

# 喜鹊 

- 在荒野上方喜鹊飞去，
- 　在榛林冠盖的上方，
- 啊，喜鹊为何要独居？
- 　它等待贵妇和情郎。
- “你为何伤心欢颜不展？”
- 　她说：“我已无宁日，爱人。”
- “我远行将是那么短暂。”
- 　她说：“我们别再会，爱人。”

<br />

- 他们在草地上四处漫步，
- 　驻足听割草人挥镰声；
- 他边唱歌儿边起伏，正午
- 　影子在身子下移动。
- “红脸膛年轻割草人他唱，
- 　在世上[作乐](#1)不是错，爱人。”
- 她说：“他在唱众生皆悲怆，
- 　他不懂别的法则，爱人。”

<br />

- 禾草、莎草和小小芦鹪鹩，
- 　一个社交圈在交谈；
- 溪水说着，来十只就够了，
- 　他们正走过溪流边。
- “禾草、莎草和小小芦鹪鹩
- 　低一声高一声正说话，爱人，
- 林中有欢宴，泽中有嬉闹。”
- 　她说：“它们叹息啊，爱人。”

<br />

- 它飞过草地，飞过树丛，
- 　她见它飞越芦苇，
- 经沼泽往下，尾巴晃动，
- 　那喜鹊形单影只。
- “你为何伤心欢颜不展？”
- 　她说：“我已无宁日，爱人。”
- 啊，出于爱干傻事欺骗，
- 　她说：“我们别再会，爱人。”
