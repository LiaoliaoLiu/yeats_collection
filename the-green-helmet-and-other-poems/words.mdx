# Words
- I had this thought a while ago,
- ‘My darling cannot understand
- What I have done, or what would do
- In this blind bitter land.’

<br />

- And I grew weary of the sun
- Until my thoughts cleared up again,
- Remembering that the best I have done
- Was done to make it plain;

<br />

- That every year I have cried, ‘At length
- My darling understands it all,
- Because I have come into my strength,
- And words obey my call’;

<br />

- That had she done so who can say
- What would have shaken from the sieve?
- I might have thrown poor words away
- And been content to live.

# 文字
- 不久前我曾经这样想：
- “我爱人怕不能理解
- 这盲目苦难的土地上
- 我做过或要做什么。”

<br />

- 对太阳我渐生厌倦心
- 到思绪重新变清晰，
- 忆想起最优良的行径
- 是曾经诚实地坦白；

<br />

- 我每年都大喊：“到头来
- 我爱人会理解一切，
- 因为我已攒足了力气，
- 文字也听从我驱策”；

<br />

- 假如她理解了谁能说
- 筛子中会漏下什么？
- 我也许把破文字抛却，
- 心满意足地去生活。
