# The Meditation of the Old Fisherman
- You waves, though you dance by my feet like children at play,
- Though you glow and you glance, though you purr and you dart;
- In the Junes that were warmer than these are, the waves were
-  more gay,
- When I was a boy with never a crack in my heart.

<br />

- The herring are not in the tides as they were of old;
- My sorrow! for many a creak gave the creel in the cart
- That carried the take: to Sligo town to be sold,
- When I was a boy with never a crack in my heart.

<br />

- And ah, you proud maiden, you are not so fair when his oar
- Is heard on the water, as they were, the proud and apart,
- Who paced in the eve by the nets on the pebbly shore,
- When I was a boy with never a crack in my heart.

# 老渔夫的幽思

- 海浪哟，虽然你们像玩耍的孩子般在我脚边跳舞，
- 虽然你们脸放光，眼发亮，虽然你们叫声欢，脚步轻，
- 但是从前的六月比近来的更暖和，海浪也更
- 　　欢娱，
- 那时候我还是个小伙子，心里面还没有一丝裂痕。

<br />

- 大群的鲱鱼再也不像往日那样在潮水里洄游；
- 真让人悲伤！当年大车上的藤筐咯吱吱响个不停，
- 满载着一网打来的鲜鱼到斯来沟县城里去出售，
- 那时候我还是个小伙子，心里面还没有一丝裂痕。

<br />

- 啊，骄傲的女孩儿，哪怕他的桨声在水面上荡响，
- 你也不比她们漂亮，那些骄傲又出众的美人，
- 她们曾经在黄昏时分漫步在卵石滩上的鱼网旁，
- 那时候我还是个小伙子，心里面还没有一丝裂痕。

<PoemFootnote>
此诗作于1886年6月，最初发表于《爱尔兰月刊》（1886年10月）。叶芝（1895）称“此诗所根据的是一个从斯来沟湾捕鱼归来的渔夫对我说的一些话”（《校刊本》，页797）。

<PoemFootnote>
Yeats claimed that 'This is an attempt to reconstruct an old song from
three lines imperfectly remembered by an old peasant woman in the vil-
lage of Ballysodare, Sligo, who often sings them to herself' (1889: VP p.
90). The work is close to the first two stanzas of a poem with the same
title in the P. J. McCall Ballad Collection in the National Library of Ire-
land. Yeats glossed 'salley' as 'willow' (1895; VP p. 797).
